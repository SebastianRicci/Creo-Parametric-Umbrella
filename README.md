# Umbrella

Functional umbrella designed with Creo Parametric.This project began with drawing and designing each individual part before making a 3D model and part structure.The assembly of the umbrella works with movement restrictions meaning that you can open and close it as you would with a normal umbrella.The "Umbrella" folder contains several subfolders each with different type of file extensions in them.

## Subfolder Index
* Assembly = Here you can see the 3D model of the umbrella complete with its movement restrictions.
* Drawings = Individual and collective design drawings of each piece and different views and sections of the umbrella.
* Run-Umbrella = It's necessary to open this subfolder in order to run the assembly correctly.
* Videos = Videos of the 3D modeled umbrella opening and closing, showing its movement restrictions.
